## Subject

This iOS application was developped as a 4th year Swift project in 3 weeks.
The objective of the project was to design and develop an application to manage and share expenses between friends during trips in
group. Several applications of this style already exist. We can mention the most known, Tricount, but also Splitwise for example.

The application allows to manage Trips, Expenses, Users and also to get the balance at any time. Also, it computes money sharing in a way that minimizes the exchanges of money.
